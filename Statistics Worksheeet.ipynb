    "10. What do you understand by the term Normal Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The normal distribution is the most widely known and used of all distributions. Because the normal distribution\n",
    "    approximates many natural phenomena so well, it has developed into a standard of reference for many\n",
    "    probability problems.\n",
    "    The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is the most important probability approximately normally distributed; measurement\n",
    "    errors also often have a normal distribution. The normal distribution is easy to work with mathematically. In\n",
    "    many practical cases, the methods developed using normal theory work quite well even when the\n",
    "    distribution is not normal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. How do you handle missing data? What imputation techniques do you recommend?\n",
    "Ans-The problem of missing value is quite common in many reallife datasets. Missing value can bias the results of the\n",
    "     machine learning models and/or reduce the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "     Missing data is defined as the values or data that is not stored (or not present) for some variable/s in the given dataset.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Imputation techniques:\n",
    "    The imputation technique replaces missing values with substituted values. The missing values can be imputed in\n",
    "    many ways depending upon the nature of the data and its problem.\n",
    "    1.Imputation using Statistics:\n",
    "          The syntax is the same as imputation with constant only the\n",
    "       SimpleImputer strategy will change. It can be “Mean” or “Median” or “Most_Frequent”.\n",
    "       “Mean” will replace missing values using the mean in each column. It is preferred if data is numeric and not skewed.\n",
    "       “Median” will replace missing values using the median in each column. It is preferred if data is numeric and skewed.\n",
    "       “Most_frequent” will replace missing values using the most_frequent in each column. It is preferred if data is a\n",
    "          string(object) or numeric. Before using any strategy, the foremost step is to check the\n",
    "          type of data and distribution of features(if numeric).\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. What is A/B testing?\n",
    "Ans- A/B testing is basically statistical hypothesis testing, or,in other words, statistical inference. It is an analytical\n",
    "     method for making decisions that estimates population parameters based on sample statistics.\n",
    "     The concept is similar to the scientific method. If you want to find out what happens when you change\n",
    "     one thing, you have to create a situation where only that one thing changes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "13. Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice?\n",
    "Ans- The process of replacing null values in a data collection with the data’s mean is known as mean imputation.\n",
    "     Mean imputation is typically considered terrible practice since it ignores feature correlation. Consider the following\n",
    "     scenario: we have a table with age and fitness scores, and an eight-year-old has a missing fitness score. If we average the\n",
    "     fitness scores of people between the ages of 15 and 80, the eighty-year-old will appear to have a significantly greater\n",
    "     fitness level than he actually does.\n",
    "     Second, mean imputation decreases the variance of our data while increasing bias. As a result of the reduced variance, the\n",
    "      model is less accurate and the confidence interval is narrower.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "14. What is linear regression in statistics?\n",
    "Ans-Linear Regression:\n",
    "    ➢ Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable\n",
    "      If we want to use a variable x to draw conclusions concerning a variable y: y is called dependent or response variable. x is\n",
    "       called independent, predictor, or explanatory variable. If the relationship between two variables is linear is can be\n",
    "      summarized by a straight line. A straight line can be described by an equation:\n",
    "                      y= a + bx\n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "15. What are the various branches of statistics?\n",
    "Ans-➢ There are basically four branches into which statistics is divided.\n",
    "     1. Mathematical or theoretical statistics\n",
    "           It helps in forming the experimental and statistical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2. Statistical methods or functions\n",
    "            It helps in the collection, tabulation and interpretation of the data. It helps in analyzing the data and returns insight\n",
    "        from the data\n",
    "   \n",
    "     3. Descriptive statistics\n",
    "             It helps in summarizing and organizing any data set characteristics. It also helps in the representation of data\n",
    "         in both classification and diagrammatic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "     4. Inferential Statistics\n",
    "             Inferential statistics are often used to compare the differences between the treatment groups. Inferential\n",
    "        statistics use measurements from the sample of subjects in the experiment to compare the treatment groups and\n",
    "         make generalizations about the larger population of subjects. "
